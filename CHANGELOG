2010-09-16
  - fixed bug where capistrano task set_branch would not set the proper branch
  - fixed bug where capistrano task print_latest_tags would blow up (thanks to Ian Zabel for help in debugging)
  - fixed bug where capistrano would not write the text file to the server if an explicit branch was not set
  - fixed bug where passing -v to autotag would show the help, not the version

2010-08-10

- Added the following commands
  - help
  - version
  - create STAGE
  - list STAGE
  - cleanup STAGE
  - delete_locally STAGE
  - delete_on_remote STAGE
- Added the following options to autotag
  --date-separator - the character used to separate parts of the timestamp
  --fetch-refs - whether to fetch refs before creating or listing them
  --push-refs - whether to push refs after creating them
  --remote - specify a custom remote (defaults to "origin")
  --ref-path - use a different ref directory, other than "tags"
  --stages - specify all of the stages
  --offline - don't push or fetch refs (is ignored with delete_on_remote command)
  --dry-run - don't execute anything, but print the commands
  --verbose - prints all commands as they run
  --refs-to-keep - when using any clean commans, specify how many refs to keep
  --executable - specify the full path to the git executable
  --opts-file - the location of an additional opts file

- Fixed the exit status in autotag executable (thank you Sarah Mei)

2010-04-25

- Fixed creating incorrect tags when deploying from a branch, tag, or from head (Brian Takita & Bruce Krysiak)
- Namespaced all classes under AutoTagger (Pat Nakajima)
- Renamed Commander.execute! to Commander.execute? (Pat Nakjima)

2009-10-15

- You can now define your stages as strings or symbols and auto-tagger will not fail (thanks to Chad Wooley for the bug report)
- When deploying from a branch auto_tagger uses real_revision, not the previous tag, to create the new tag (Brian Takita)

2009-04-30

- Fixed bug whereby auto-tagger would use the wrong tag because it found tags that had similar names to what it uses.

2009-04-20

- `release_tagger:create_ref` creates a production tag if you don't set any stages

2009-04-05

- Added basic support for cap-ext-multistage
- Changed "stages" variable to "autotagger_stages" so as not to conflict with the multistage "stages" variable in capistrano
- Changed the :current_stage variable in the capistrano tasks to just :stage

2009-03-31

- Capistrano bases new tags off of old tags from the previous environment when tagging if there is a tag from the previous environment
- Added the following cap tasks:
  - print_latest_refs
  - read_tag_from_shared
  - write_tag_to_shared

2009-03-29

- Capistrano tasks :set_branch no longer sets the branch to nil.  If the CapistranoHelper returns nil, it leaves the branch alone.
