- You can now define your stages as strings or symbols and auto-tagger will not fail (thanks to Chad Wooley for the bug report)
- When deploying from a branch auto_tagger uses real_revision, not the previous tag, to create the new tag (Brian Takita)

2009-04-30

- Fixed bug whereby auto-tagger would use the wrong tag because it found tags that had similar names to what it uses.

2009-04-20

- `release_tagger:create_ref` creates a production tag if you don't set any stages

2009-04-05

- Added basic support for cap-ext-multistage
- Changed "stages" variable to "autotagger_stages" so as not to conflict with the multistage "stages" variable in capistrano
- Changed the :current_stage variable in the capistrano tasks to just :stage

2009-03-31

- Capistrano bases new tags off of old tags from the previous environment when tagging if there is a tag from the previous environment
- Added the following cap tasks:
  - print_latest_refs
  - read_tag_from_shared
  - write_tag_to_shared

2009-03-29

- Capistrano tasks :set_branch no longer sets the branch to nil.  If the CapistranoHelper returns nil, it leaves the branch alone.
